### Resources on the Internet are abundant, and this makes it hard to know where to focus on. 

> Ciao guys, I’m Lore and with this guide my aim is to remove the fluff and give you the **fundamental skills and resources** required to start your Data Analytics journey 🚀

**The guide is divided into 3 categories of resources, based on the difficulty level:**

- **Beginner**

## 🏁 Let’s start with Basics (Beginner level)

This video from my YouTube channel can give you an overview on how to start your Data Analytics Journey from ZERO, especially if you don’t have a technical background (which was my case).

### Data Portfolio Basics

> Before you go into the more advanced resources online, make sure you understand the basics of a data analytics portfolio. 

The reason is simple: while you have to start putting concepts into practice so that you can showcase your skills. A certificate is good but a project in your portfolio is what will make you stand out from the crowd…

This is the perfect project to start your data analytics journey - no skills required to start, you will just need Excel to give it a go. Also, companies still heavily rely on Excel so, even if it has its limitations, do not overestimate it and get familiar with it before moving to other fancy tools.
